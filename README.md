# AllShared - Community Sharing Platform

A peer-to-peer borrowing and sharing platform designed to help people share items within their community. Inspired by the principle of communal generosity, this platform encourages users to lend and borrow items safely, sustainably, and without the expectation of profit.

## ðŸš§ Project Status

This project is currently in the initial planning phase. The repository structure and core application will be implemented using:

- **Backend:** Ruby on Rails
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** Rails views with modern CSS/JavaScript (framework TBD)

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision

Foster a culture of trust, cooperation, and reduced consumption by allowing community resources to circulate instead of being purchased unnecessarily. Based on Acts 4:32: *"All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had."*

This platform adapts that principle for a modern, inclusive community that welcomes everyone, regardless of belief background.

## âœ¨ Planned Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Borrowing:** List items to lend and browse available items from others
- **Collateral System:** Optional collateral via secure methods (PayID, cash) for high-value items
- **Pseudonymous Profiles:** Privacy-protected lender profiles with trust signals (ratings, successful loans, verification badges)
- **Community-Driven Trust:** Reputation system through successful transactions and feedback
- **Safe Exchanges:** Public meeting locations with time-limited contact tokens
- **Sustainability Focus:** Promote reuse over purchasing to support sustainable living
- **Optional Charity Donations:** Borrowers can thank lenders by donating to suggested charities
